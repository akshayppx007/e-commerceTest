npm install
npm run dev
```

## Server Setup

Before running the server, make sure to set the DB_URI environment variable in the .env file.
To add products, you need to set up your own Cloudinary account.

```env
NODE_ENV = PRODUCTION
DB_URI =

JWT_SECRET =
JWT_EXPIRES_TIME = 60
COOKIE_EXPIRES_TIME = 60

CLOUDINARY_NAME =
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY =
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET =
```


```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
